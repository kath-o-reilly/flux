## Abstract

Influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic evolution allowing mutant viruses to evade host
immunity acquired to previous virus strains. Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise
measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize
antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus
phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza A subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 and influenza B lineages Victoria
and Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across lineages and show that antigenic drift
drives incidence rates and mediates interference between influenza lineages. Additionally, we
describe the selective underpinnings of differences in antigenic drift across lineages. This work
makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other
antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and
antigenic evolution.
