## Abstract

Influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic evolution allowing mutant viruses to evade immunity
acquired by the host population to previous virus strains. Antigenic phenotype is often assessed
through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic
cartography, which seeks to place strains on an antigenic map, such that distances on this map best
recapitulate titers observed across multiple HI assays. In our model, we simultaneously characterize
antigenic and genetic evolution by including an evolutionary model in which antigenic location
diffuses over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data for four lineages of influenza, encompassing
influenza A subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, and influenza B lineages Victoria and Yamagata, we determine
average rates of antigenic drift for each lineage, as well as year-to-year variability in the rate
of drift. Through comparison with epidemiological data, we demonstrate a year-to-year correlation
between drift and incidence and present evidence that antigenic drift mediates interference between
influenza lineages. We investigate the selective underpinnings for differing antigenic dynamics
across lineages and show that A/H3N2 benefits from both a higher influx of new antigenic mutations
and also from more efficient conversion of antigenic variation into fixed differences. This work
does much to elucidate the antigenic dynamics of influenza lineages, but also allows for substantial
future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable
pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution.
