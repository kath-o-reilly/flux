@article{Fitch97,
	Abstract = {We have studied the HA1 domain of 254 human influenza A(H3N2) virus genes for clues that might help identify characteristics of hemagglutinins (HAs) of circulating strains that are predictive of that strain's epidemic potential. Our preliminary findings include the following. (i) The most parsimonious tree found requires 1,260 substitutions of which 712 are silent and 548 are replacement substitutions. (ii) The HA1 portion of the HA gene is evolving at a rate of 5.7 nucleotide substitutions/year or 5.7 x 10(-3) substitutions/site per year. (iii) The replacement substitutions are distributed randomly across the three positions of the codon when allowance is made for the number of ways each codon can change the encoded amino acid. (iv) The replacement substitutions are not distributed randomly over the branches of the tree, there being 2.2 times more changes per tip branch than for non-tip branches. This result is independent of how the virus was amplified (egg grown or kidney cell grown) prior to sequencing or if sequencing was carried out directly on the original clinical specimen by PCR. (v) These excess changes on the tip branches are probably the result of a bias in the choice of strains to sequence and the detection of deleterious mutations that had not yet been removed by negative selection. (vi) There are six hypervariable codons accumulating replacement substitutions at an average rate that is 7.2 times that of the other varied codons. (vii) The number of variable codons in the trunk branches (the winners of the competitive race against the immune system) is 47 +/- 5, significantly fewer than in the twigs (90 +/- 7), which in turn is significantly fewer variable codons than in tip branches (175 +/- 8). (viii) A minimum of one of every 12 branches has nodes at opposite ends representing viruses that reside on different continents. This is, however, no more than would be expected if one were to randomly reassign the continent of origin of the isolates. (ix) Of 99 codons with at least four mutations, 31 have ratios of non-silent to silent changes with probabilities less than 0.05 of occurring by chance, and 14 of those have probabilities <0.005. These observations strongly support positive Darwinian selection. We suggest that the small number of variable positions along the successful trunk lineage, together with knowledge of the codons that have shown positive selection, may provide clues that permit an improved prediction of which strains will cause epidemics and therefore should be used for vaccine production.},

Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T-Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. The MUSCLE program, source code and PREFAB test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.},

@article{Nelson07NatRevGenet,
	Abstract = {Recent developments in complete-genome sequencing, antigenic mapping and epidemiological modelling are greatly improving our knowledge of the evolution of human influenza virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, recent studies have revealed a more complex relationship between antigenic evolution, natural selection and reassortment than previously realized. Despite these advances, there is much that remains to be understood about the epidemiology of influenza virus, particularly the processes that determine the virus's strong seasonality. We argue that a complete understanding of the evolutionary biology of this important human pathogen will require a genomic view of genetic diversity, including the acquisition of polymorphism data from within individual hosts and from geographical regions, particularly the tropics, which have been poorly surveyed to date.},

@article{Russell08,
	Abstract = {Antigenic and genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin of approximately 13,000 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from six continents during 2002-2007 revealed that there was continuous circulation in east and Southeast Asia (E-SE Asia) via a region-wide network of temporally overlapping epidemics and that epidemics in the temperate regions were seeded from this network each year. Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-SE Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution. If the trends observed during this period are an accurate representation of overall patterns of spread, then the antigenic characteristics of A (H3N2) viruses outside E-SE Asia may be forecast each year based on surveillance within E-SE Asia, with consequent improvements to vaccine strain selection.},

	Abstract = {The antigenic evolution of influenza A (H3N2) virus was quantified and visualized from its introduction into humans in 1968 to 2003. Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

	Abstract = {Background:Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on their hemagglutinin {(H1} to H15) and neuraminidase {(N1} to N9) glycoproteins. Of these, three A subtypes {H1N1}, {H3N2} and {H1N2} circulate in the human population. Influenza A viruses display a high antigenic variability called ‚{\"A}{\'u}ntigenic drift‚{\"A}{\`u} which allows the virus to escape antibody neutralization. Objectives: Evaluate the mutations apparition that might predict a divergent antigenic evolution of hemagglutinin in influenza A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} viruses. Study Design: During the three winters of 2001‚{\"A}{\`\i}2002 to 2003‚{\"A}{\`\i}2004, 58 A {H1N1} and 23 A {H1N2} subtypes have been isolated from patients with influenza-like illness in the south of France. The {HA1} region was analyzed by {RT-PCR} and subsequently sequenced to compare the {HA1} genetic evolution of influenza A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} subtypes. Results: Our results showed that 28 amino acid substitutions have accumulated in the {HA1} region since the circulation of {A/New} Caledonia/20/99-like viruses in France. Of these, fifteen were located in four antigenic sites {(B}, C, D and E). Six of them were observed only in the A {H1N2} isolates, six only in the A {H1N1} isolates and three in both subtypes. Furthermore, nine of twenty two A {H1N2} isolates from the winter of 2002‚{\"A}{\`\i}2003 shared a {T90A} amino acid change which has not been observed in any A {H1N1} isolate; resulting in the introduction of a new glycosylation site close to the antigenic site E. This might mask some antigenic E determinants and therefore, modify the A {H1N2} antigenicity. Conclusions: The divergent genetic evolution of hemagglutinin may ultimately lead to a significant different antigenicity between A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} subtypes that would require the introduction of a new subtype in the vaccine batches.},

However, a few recombinant viruses containing the new variant {HA} and genes of {H3N2} origin were identified. Antigenic analysis of {H3N2} viruses indicated that they were also heterogeneous. The majority of these virus isolates were antigenically intermediate between {A/Texas/1/77} and {A/Bangkok/1/79}, but additional variants were detected. Genomic analysis revealed that the {H3N2} viruses isolated in the winter of 1980-81 were quite similar to {H3N2} viruses isolated from 1977-79 in their T1 oligonucleotide maps. No {H1N1} genes were detected in {H3N2} virus isolates. Comparison of pairs of oligonucleotide maps of total virus {RNA} indicated that a similar rate of genetic change had occurred for nonrecombinant {H1N1} viruses, for recombinant {H1N1} viruses, and for {H3N2} viruses and that, in general, pairs of viruses exhibited increasing numbers of changes in their oligonucleotide maps as the time interval between isolation of the viruses increased.},

	Abstract = {Laboratory investigations of virus isolation and serum antibodies in a Mediterranean country {(Italy)} demonstrated that influenza A and B viruses, and often both, circulated every winter in Italy. The winter 1987/88 was characterized by a low level of influenza activity, as shown by the limited number (47) of influenza virus isolates, the majority of which (61\%) belonged to the influenza B type. In contrast, the 1988/89 influenza season was exclusively associated with the circulation of influenza type A viruses. The {A(H1H1)} subtype was largely predominant (97\%), as compared to the low incidence of the {A(H3N2)} subtype (3\%). During the 1989/90 winter a co-circulation of A and B influenza viruses was observed, {A(H3N2)} strains being responsible for 96\% of the virologically confirmed cases. Antigenic analysis of the virus isolates showed some antigenic variation in influenza A viruses of both {H1N1} and {H3N2} subtypes, whilst antigenic stability was found among the influenza B virus isolates. Overall, the above virological findings correlate with the data concerning the pattern of influenza virus circulation in Northern Europe and the {UK} during the three years surveyed. The results of serum antibody surveys conducted in each post-epidemic period are also reported.},

In 1994, viruses emerged in China, including {A/Beijing/262/95}, with profound antigenic differences from the contemporary circulating {H1N1} strains. Haemagglutinin sequence comparisons of either a predecessor virus, {A/Hebei/52/94}, or one representative of the cocirculating {A/Bayern/7/95-like} clade, {A/Shenzhen/227/95}, revealed a deletion of K at position 134 {(H3} numbering) in the antigenic variants. The K134 deletion conferred a selective advantage to the Chinese deletion lineage, such that it eventually gave rise to currently circulating H1 viruses. Using reverse genetics to generate viruses with either an insertion or deletion of aa 134, we have confirmed that the K134 deletion, rather than a constellation of sublineage specific amino acid changes, was sufficient for the antigenic difference observed in the Chinese deletion lineage, and reinsertion of K134 revealed the requirement of a compatible neuraminidase surface glycoprotein for viral growth.},

The results obtained with five different monoclones to each molecule were compared with the results obtained with postinfection ferret sera. Monoclonal antibodies and postinfection ferret sera detected antigenic drift in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules of {H1N1} viruses and monoclonal antibodies showed that the {A/USSR/90/77}, A/ Roma/1/49, and {A/Fort} Warren/1/50 viruses were identical at five sites on both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules. To further evaluate monoclonal antibodies, they were used in hemagglutination inhibition tests with recently isolated influenza {A(HlNl)} viruses, including some shown in tests with postinfection ferret sera to have undergone antigenic drift. Three patterns of reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies were detected with the variants: two variants differed at two of the five sites identified by the monoclonal antibodies and a third variant differed at only one of the five sites. Two of these variant groupings had not been distinguished from each other in {HI} tests with ferret sera, whereas ferret sera were capable of distinguishing between two groups of variants that had similar reaction patterns with the five monoclonal antibody preparations. Monoclonal antibodies failed to detect antigenic drift in the {NA} molecules of the recent isolates of {H1N1} influenza viruses, suggesting that antigenic changes occur less frequently in this molecule. The observation that antigenic differences could be detected between the recent variants with such a small panel of monoclonal antibodies (less than 10\% of the number obtained to the {HA} of {A/PR/8/34)} suggests that monoclonal antibodies may provide an exquisitely sensitive method for antigenic mapping of influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region of the haemagglutinin gene coding for the {HA1} domain of the protein was performed on 19 human influenza A strains of {HI} subtype representative of the two epidemic periods from 1977‚{\"A}{\`\i}1983 and from 1950‚{\"A}{\`\i}1957. The amino acid changes relative to {A/USSR/90/77} are summarised and are consistent with the view that variation in these field strains involves changes largely at the Sb and Ca antigenic sites previously characterised in laboratory mutants of the haemagglutinin of influenza {A/PR/8/34.} The Sa and Cb sites are less variant and are probably masked by carbohydrate side chains. We discuss the significance of other amino acid changes which do not correspond to previously defined antigenic sites. We also define the ‚{\"A}{\'u}mainstream‚{\"A}{\`u} amino acid changes characteristic of the divergent evolutionary pathways of the 1950‚{\"A}{\`\i}1957 and 1977‚{\"A}{\`\i}1983 periods and note that the rate of evolution is faster in the earlier period.},
